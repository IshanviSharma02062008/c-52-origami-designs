                    Chameleons spend most of their lives in bushes or trees, where they can hide from predators and wait for food.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They're unique among lizards because they have zygodactylous toes, meaning their feet can grip tree trunks and limbs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chameleons can often have over 20 babies in one period (called a clutch). Talk about a full house! Once a baby chameleon breaks through the membrane and shell of the egg, it is out in the world to start its life!

                 Pigeons can move their wings ten times per second and maintain heartbeats at the rate of 600 times per minute, during the period of 16 hours.
             </li>
             <li>
                 Pigeons can fly at the speed of 50 to 60 miles per hour. Fastest known pigeon managed to reach speed on 92 miles per hour.
             </li>
             <li>
                 Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the 'mirror test' â€“ a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.

        <li>
            Bear skulls have unique adaptations to help eat a wide range of food.
        </li>
        <li>
            They have large canine teeth to aid in opening logs to look for insects, and to capture and eat prey and occasionally eat the remains of animals that have died.
        </li>
        <li>
            Considered by many wildlife biologists to be one of the most intelligent land animals of North America, bears possess the largest and most convoluted brains relative to their size of any land mammal. In the animal kingdom, their intelligence compares with that of higher primates.

                Another finding suggests pandas have remarkable memories, at least when it comes to their favorite food, bamboo. 
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Pandas have core areas where they prefer to feed, moving from one spot to the next as they exhaust the bamboo.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                They are born furless and blind. The limbs of newborn pandas are so weak that they are not able to stand at all. For 2 months after birth, baby pandas rely on the mother's warmth, milk, and protection.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.
        </li>
        <li>
            They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes.
